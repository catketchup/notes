Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.

return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
